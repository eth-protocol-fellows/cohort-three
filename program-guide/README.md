- [Suggested reading](./reading.md) list with high level overview of areas in Ethereum protocol
- [EthR&D Discord Guidebook](https://github.com/tvanepps/EthereumDiscordGuidebook) 
   - This guide contains many sources for orientation, not only for the R&D Discord but all of Ethereum R&D.
   - If you find anything useful which would fit in there, feel free to contribute by expanding it.
