# Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Program Details

The development of the core Ethereum protocols is some of the most important and impactful work you can do in the Ethereum ecosystem. Open source protocols and accompanying open source software and clients that implement those protocol rules are the foundation everything else is built upon.

The Ethereum protocols are going through the most significant updates and upgrades since genesis and there is much to do. We need more talented and dedicated people to be part of this process. If you are interested in joining this effort the doors are open. You just have to walk through them.

## What Is It

The *Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (formerly Core Developer Apprentice Program)* is a program designed to onboard developers to the process through which the protocol development happens. It is an opportunity to dive deep into the protocol and learn while also working closely with others on the same learning trajectory as well as the core development community.

*This program will not teach or focus in any way on smart contract development or creating blockchain applications.*

Over the course of the 4 month program, EPF participants will receive project support and mentorship as well as a monthly stipend while working on a project of their choosing. Participants can expect
- a weekly call with participants
- selected mentorship with applicable devs
- monthly demo days
- optional In-person meetups
- project documentation guidance

## Who is it for?

Successful candidates will have most of the following skills. It is ok if you have some weak areas, but you should expect to focus on improving them.
While none of these guidelines are hard requirements for applicants, The most successful applicants will:

- have strong verbal and written communication skills
- be self-directed and self-motivated
- have a technical foundation
- are able to write code

### Verbal and Written communication
Core development requires you to be able to write your ideas down in a manner that is clear and easy to understand. In addition, you will need to be able to discuss your ideas in person and over voice and video calls. The majority of protocol development happens in English.
### Self Directed
Core development requires the ability to tackle a problem in a self-directed way. You will have a community of knowledgeable people to support you, but the ultimate responsibility for figuring things out is yours. The program will operate in much the same way. While mentorship is an important part of this program, mentors are there to unlock doors and remove barriers. There will be near-zero "teaching". 
### Technical Foundation
Core development is deeply technical. You will consistently be required to learn and understand new things. We don't expect you to have a deep understanding of the domain-specific knowledge, but you should have a solid technical foundation. This could be things like experience with software development, a computer science or math background, or being able to read and very loosely understand the Ethereum yellow paper. You should be confident in your ability to learn and understand complex technical things.
### Ability to "Write Code"
You don't have to be a seasoned software engineer. But almost everyone who is successful in core development has some ability to use code to implement and validate their ideas.
### Intrinsically Motivated
This is probably the most important one. You need a strong inherent desire to do this work. Working on open source and open protocols. Building decentralized peer to peer networks. Improving client architecture. Developing and improving low-level EVM mechanics. Contributing to the public good.

You are not expected to have expert-level skills in all of these areas, but you should expect to spend time improving on any weak areas.

## Selection Criteria
Candidate selection will take the following things into account.
- Your application and areas of interest
- Your history of open source contributions
- Your existing contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem
- Relevant prior work experience
We will be prioritizing candidates which have something that we consider a strong signal of both interest and ability.

*There are life situations which may result in a capable candidate not being able to easily demonstrate their ability. An example would be a long career in private industry working in a closed-source environment. If this is your situation, you are encouraged to explain your situation and make as compelling a case as possible for why you should be considered.*

## How it will work

Applications will open at the beginning of September and remain open for two weeks, closing on September 15th.

The program will formally run for 4 months, from October through January. This gives us the opportunity to organize physical meetups at Ethereum conferences like [Devcon](https://devcon.org) and [EthDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com).

Timeline of the 4 month program will follow these stages:

### Phase One
- Initial meeting with individual participants, interviewing and providing program orientation.
- Initial group session, presenting the introduction to the program and areas of focus.
- Learn about chosen problems, form teams and create a write up of a topic they are interested in based on input from mentors.
### Phase Two
- Deep dive into identified areas. Learn and familiarize with previous work and current solutions.
- Connect with chosen mentors and work towards defining a deliverable project.
- Write and submit a report on the selected problem(s), suggested solutions, and a roadmap for working on the issue throughout the program.
- Report presentation to other participants and select mentors to gather final feedback.
### Phase Three
- Execute project roadmap to complete deliverables
- Publish weekly progress updates.
- Weekly group calls (stand up) with participants and mentors.
### Program End
- Project wrap up and looking forward to further contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem
- Project showcase to group and mentors

During this entire process, participants will have access to mentors and the core developer community for things like answering questions and getting feedback on ideas. Participants should not expect the core developers to actively guide them.

A common weekly "stand up" meeting will be held for all teams during which they will go over 
1. What they've been working on
2. What they are working on next
3. Anything that is blocking their work.

## Will you be paid?

Our goal is to provide an opportunity for you to get paid to learn. We will work with individual applicants to determine a "stipend" amount which will allow you to focus your effort on this program. Some candidates will be selected for funding at the start of the program. Other candidates who choose to participate independent of funding may be extended the option to receive funding as the program progresses.

## Who is running the program?

The program is funded by the Ethereum Foundation and run by the Protocol Support Team at the Ethereum Foundation. It is important to note that the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/) does not own, operate, or manage Ethereum but exists to support the protocol and the Ethereum community through funding and research.
