# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some frequently asked questions about EPF program.

- **Will I learn to develop applications on the Ethereum blockchain?**
    - No. This program is not focused on Solidity or development of decentralized applications. 
- **I'm not able to commit to "full time" (aka 40 hours a week).  Can I still apply?**
    - Yes. There are no hard restrictions on how many hours you must put towards the program. The amount of time you will need to invest is going to depend on your current level of knowledge and what project you choose to pursue.  It will likely be difficult to be successful in the program if you are unable to commit at least 20 hours per week.
- **What projects can I work on?**
    - Participants have full freedom in deciding what they want to work on. You are free to propose a project but you can also get inspiration from mentors' project ideas. The project you choose has to be related to the core protocol and touch some area of current Ethereum roadmap. 
- **I don't know much about ______________.  Can I still apply?**
    - Yes. Applicants are expected to have gaps in their knowledge.  You should still read through the [program details](/program-structure.md) to get a sense for what type of prior knowledge you should be working towards to be successful in the program.
- **When does it start and is the duration?**
    - Program will start in beginning of October and continue for 4 months. 
- **What happens after the 4 months is complete?**
    - Assuming you are "successful" in the program, we will work to continue "enabling" you to focus your effort on the protocol.  This could be continued "grant" style funding, helping you find a job on a team that's working on something interesting to you, or whatever it is that we can help with to keep you working with us.
- **Where is the fellowship located?**
    - As all core Ethereum teams, EPF is distributed around the globe. For calls, there will be asigned times for western and eastern timezones. 
- **Who are the mentors and how can I interact with them?**
    - You can find all available mentors and info on how the mentorship works [here](./mentors.md).
- **Will funding be in ETH or Fiat?**
    - Both ETH or Fiat will be available.
- **Will there be an interview process?**
    - Yes. After reviewing applications, we will invite chosen aplicants for an interview. 
- **How many applicants will be accepted in the first cohort?**
    - The exact number depends on number of application and capacity of mentors. Roughly speaking, we are targeting between 10 and 20 participants.
- **Can I still participate even if I am not selected in this cohort?**
    - Yes. Being "selected" into the program is really just the group that we'll be working directly with to provide funding. The program is going to happen in the "open" meaning that anyone who wants to participate can be a part of the program on the same footing as those that are "selected". We're looking into how we can provide some support for those that don't get selected but who choose to be a part of the program anyway.  There will probably be an opportunity for those that aren't selected, but who do need funding to do this, to apply for a grant.
