## Introduction

I am Alpesh, a final-year PhD Student at Royal Holloway, University of London. My research focuses on the exploitation of security flaws and design-time assumptions by extortionware and ransomware, and the remediation of those issues. My early work focused on leveraging secure enclaves (SGX) to protect ransomware keys from anti-ransomware software (e.g., Paybreak), in the interests of highlighting the lack of depth in contemporary anti-ransomware approaches [1]. This has since evolved into a body of work that includes Ethereum Proof-of-Stake validators as potential targets for next generation ransomware.

## Research Interests

My primary interest in joining the program is to investigate how the current protocol could be improved such that it allows validators whose keys have been compromised to perform a key update (before withdrawal functionality is enabled as part of the Shanghai upgrade) without having to exit.

### Updates
I'll aim to update my progress on a fortnightly basis:
