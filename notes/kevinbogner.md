## Journal
**[11/08/2022]**
- More discussion on the [draft PR](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/260) for the beacon API endpoints.
- Published [Dev Update #4](https://hackmd.io/@lODlsf2CR9uWlyIyEdjjPQ/B1UFETvro).

**[11/07/2022]**
- Created a [draft PR](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/260) to work with [NC](https://github.com/naviechan) on beacon API endpoints.
- Attended weekly standup call.

**[11/04/2022]**
- Discussing with [NC](https://github.com/naviechan) the [design questions](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3661#issuecomment-1304482857).

**[11/03/2022]**
- Created a [PR](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/3681) for [Issue #3672](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3672).

**[11/02/2022]**
- Continue working on a [Lighthouse Issue](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3672).

**[11/01/2022]**
- Attended [Office Hours Call #1](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/issues/41).
- Started working on a [Lighthouse Issue](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3672) to add a guide for running a full node to the doc.

**[10/31/2022]**
- Attended EPF standup call and got some advice on handling big codebases in open-source projects. Focus on small areas; don't try to understand everything and familiarize yourself with testing.
- Installed and set up Linux for [Lighthouses' development environment](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/setup.html).

**[10/30/2022]**
- Published [Dev Update #3](https://hackmd.io/@lODlsf2CR9uWlyIyEdjjPQ/HJhEF6wVj).

**[10/28/2022]**
- Continue working on Dev Update #3, which I will finish this week.
- Researching validator rewards because that's the next thing I will be working on: [Ben Edginton's book](https://eth2book.info/bellatrix/part2/incentives/rewards) and [Pintail's guide](https://pintail.xyz/posts/modelling-the-impact-of-altair/).
- Meanwhile, I continue setting up my [Lighthouse node](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), so I can start experimenting with APIs once my Dev Update is published. [Checkpoint sync](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/checkpoint-sync.html?highlight=purge#automatic-checkpoint-sync) is done, and now the node is [reconstructing states](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/checkpoint-sync.html#reconstructing-states).

**[10/27/2022]**
- Started working on Dev Update #3.
- Listened to [Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQfEW8LdE88).

**[10/26/2022]**

- Setting up [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse).
- Experimenting with [Lighthouse API](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/api.html).

**[10/25/2022]**
- Code Cleanup.
- Realized that Consensus Client Block Rewards are different depending on the source used, e.g. [Etherscan API](https://etherscan.io/apis) or https://beaconcha.in/. Therefore I might tackle the issue by proposing a new endpoint for the [Beacon-API](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/Beacon) with the help of [sproul](https://github.com/michaelsproul), who not only pointed the issue out but also has been working on an API for Consensus Client Block Rewards already.

**[10/24/2022]**
- Added [New Charts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114221396/197732818-ea516e9c-cf90-4c51-8854-9a9e3d26afd3.png) with a [Dropdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114221396/197732953-87b3f4a3-9e7f-413e-975b-870e64a428bd.png).

- Reduced the amount of required .csv files to make the website more lightweight.
- Thinking about how I want to proceed: Mid-term, I want to group the data in different timeframes to allow users time-specific drill-downs. Long-term, I want to publish the data through a Twitterbot with daily reports.

**[10/05/2022]**
- Got private API of [blockprint](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint) from [Michael Sproul](https://twitter.com/sproulM_).
- Added [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to fetch public API.
- Setup a proxy to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) to avoid CORS errors ([Guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43871637/no-access-control-allow-origin-header-is-present-on-the-requested-resource-whe)).
- Added [blockprint](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint) public API ([Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114221396/194077899-a7e846ba-493e-4751-b2b4-6f27ca700f40.png)).

**[10/04/2022]**

- Gathered feedback from R&D Discord: Maybe fees earned/client is interesting.
- Asked in Sigma Primes Discord about the API of [blockprint](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint).

**[10/03/2022]**
- Research on Consensus Layer and Execution Layer.
- Research on React App.
- Configured the [first Layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114221396/193602030-5ab6b761-93c2-4416-8331-ab14fc7a1218.png) of my project.

**[10/02/2022]**
- Created the [draft](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114221396/193452397-19a40781-27bc-4218-b08c-5a42183c37e2.png) of how my project could look like.
- Gathered feedback from R&D Discord regarding the draft and some additional clarifications.
- Writeup of the [README](https://github.com/kevinbogner/data-analysis-consensus-clients).

**[10/01/2022]**
- Create my Folder structure for EPF cohort 3.
- Research about [Miga Labs](https://migalabs.es/api-documentation), similar to Blockprint, also provides data for the Consensus Client diversity.

**[09/30/2022]**
- Research about the [Project ideas](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md) proposed by the program's mentors.
- Brainstorming about [Browser tooling](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md#browser-tooling) and with input from [potuz](https://github.com/potuz) & [parithosh](https://github.com/parithosh) decided to dig deeper into **forkchoice** and **Client diversity**.
- Checked out [protovis](https://github.com/tbenr/protovis) work by [tbenr](https://github.com/tbenr), which visualizes the forkchoice. This could possibly be expanded by additionally offering historical data.
- Checked out [Blockprint](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint) work by [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), which gathers data for the Client diversity of the Beacon chain as shown in [sproulM_'s](https://twitter.com/sproulM_/status/1481109509544513539) tweet. There's already [this](https://clientdiversity.org/) site, which shows the client diversity of Ethereum. Partially based on Blockprint data.
- Experimented with [Blockprint's Public API](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint/blob/main/docs/api.md).
- [potuz](https://github.com/potuz) suggested tracking events like block proposals and attestations to catch network splits across clients.
- Set up [my repo](https://github.com/kevinbogner/data-analysis-consensus-clients) for EPF with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
