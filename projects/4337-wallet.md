# 4337 Wallet

We are moving closer towards the finalisation of [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). A lot of effort by the core team has been put into designing the contracts, mempool, DOS protections etc. But the team haven't had time to properly support UserOps through one of the browser extension wallets.

In this cohort, I intend to work on making a user-facing wallet which can then pave the way forward for the wallets in the Ethereum ecosystem. The larger goal is to test the eip enough and make it ready for everyday use. Once we get AAs into everyday use we can then easily work towards the depreciation of EOAs from the ecosystem.
