# 4337 Wallet

We are moving closer towards the finalisation of [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). A lot of efforts by the core team has been put in designing the contracts, mempool, DOS protections etc. But the team haven't had time to properly support UserOps through one of the browser extension wallets.

In this cohort, I indend to work on making a user facing wallet which can then pave way forward for the wallets in Ethereum ecosystem. The larger goal is to test the eip enough and make it ready for everyday use. Once we get AAs into everyday use we can then easily work towards depreciation of EOAs from the ecosystem.
